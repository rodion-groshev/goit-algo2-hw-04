## Task 1: Extend the functionality of the prefix tree

>   Implement two additional methods for the Trie class: 
- count_words_with_suffix(pattern) to count the number of words ending in a given pattern;

-   has_prefix(prefix) to check for words with a given prefix.

## Task 2: Find the longest common prefix

>  Create a LongestCommonWord class that inherits from the Trie class and implement the find_longest_common_word method, which finds the longest common prefix for all words in the input array of strings.
